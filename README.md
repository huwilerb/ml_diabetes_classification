Diabetes classification machine learning school project

This project is an academic supervised machine learning project for MS-DS course. It includes several steps:

- Gather data
- Identify a supervised machine learning problem 
- Explorative Data Analysis (EDA) -- including data cleaning
- Analysis using supervised machine learning
- produce deliverables

## MSDS notebook
The notebook for the MSDS course DTSA5509 is in `notebooks\1.cleaning_eda_models`

## Any advice ?
